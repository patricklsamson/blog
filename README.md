This rails project is a part of my compilation of Avion School Batch 8 Activities. It is focused on familiarizing the fundamentals of Ruby on Rails especially how it was separated into three components Model-View-Controller(MVC). It is deployed on Heroku and can be accessed through this [link](https://patricklsamson-blog.herokuapp.com/).

## Practice

1. Creating a New Rails App
1. [Adding Model and its Validations](https://github.com/patricklsamson/blog/blob/main/app/models/article.rb)
1. [Adding Edit, Update, and Delete Actions in Controller](https://github.com/patricklsamson/blog/blob/main/app/controllers/articles_controller.rb)
